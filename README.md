							**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a well-structured process that guides software development projects from start to finish. It provides a clear framework for planning, building, and maintaining software, ensuring that development is systematic and meets quality standards. Following SDLC software production guidelines, engineers can deliver reliable, functional software, avoid common pitfalls, and keep projects on schedule.

In this article, we will walk through the different phases of the SDLC, explore various SDLC models, and offer insights on choosing the right model for your project. Additionally, we'll highlight how Jira, an industry-leading project management tool, can help streamline the SDLC process.

**What is SDLC?**
The Software Development Life Cycle is a formalized process software engineers use to plan, design, develop, test, and maintain software applications. Defining the specific SDLC stages ensures that development is organized and executed effectively, resulting in high-quality software that meets user requirements. Following a structured approach, development teams can reduce risks, optimize resources, and produce software that aligns with business goals– all within a reasonable timeframe.

What are the main SDLC phases?
The SDLC process typically consists of several key phases, each contributing to the successful development of software. The main SDLC phases include planning, implementation, testing, and deployment, but that’s not all.

Each phase plays a crucial role in effectively designing the software, meeting user needs, and ensuring timely delivery.

Planning
The planning phase is the foundation of any successful software development project. Project goals, objectives, and requirements are gathered and documented during this phase. Project requirements can be based on customer feedback or market research evaluating existing product options. Stakeholders work together to define the project scope, establish timelines, and allocate resources. Planning establishes the project's direction, ensuring that all participants have a clear understanding of what needs to be done and how to achieve it.

Feasibility analysis
Once planning is complete, the feasibility analysis phase begins. During this phase, the project team evaluates whether the project is technically and financially viable. This includes assessing the technical requirements, estimating costs, and performing a risk analysis. Risk assessment is essential to identifying potential challenges and determining if the project is worth pursuing.

System design
The system design phase includes creating the software's architecture and design. Based on the requirements gathered during planning, the team creates a blueprint outlining how the software will function. This includes high-level architecture and detailed design specifications, including user interface design to ensure the software is user-friendly and an assessment of requirements for compatibility with existing products.

Implementation
The implementation phase, also known as the development phase, transforms the design into a functional application. It is here that the actual coding takes place. Developers write the code based on the design specifications, following best practices and coding standards to ensure the result is efficient, secure, and maintainable.

Testing
The testing phase is critical because it generates essential performance and usability feedback while revealing defects and quirks. Various types of software testing can be used, including automated testing, unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. The goal is to identify and fix bugs, ensuring the software operates as intended before being deployed to users.

Deployment
Once internal software testing is complete, the solution can be deployed to end users. This typically includes a beta-testing phase or pilot launch, limited to a select group of real-world users. Depending on the project's needs, deployment can be done on-premise or in the cloud. The deployment strategy determines how easily users can access and use the software.

Maintenance
The last phase of the SDLC is maintenance. Even after the software is deployed, ongoing support is necessary to address issues, apply updates, and add new features. Continuous maintenance ensures that the software remains functional and relevant over time.

Common SDLC models
Different software projects have different needs, and various workflow models exist to accommodate these needs. Some of the most popular SDLC models include:

Waterfall model
The Waterfall model is a linear approach to software development in which each phase must be completed before the next one begins. Each phase is based on the assumption that there were no errors in the previous phase, so developers can quickly get to work as each new phase takes effect. 

Waterfall models are straightforward and easy to manage. They are ideal for smaller projects with well-defined roles and responsibilities. However, the format's inflexibility makes it challenging to adapt to changes or nuanced tasks.

Agile model
The Agile methodology takes a flexible, iterative approach to software development. It emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and customer feedback, with development occurring in small, incremental cycles called "sprints." This framework fosters continuous evaluation so changes in direction can be easily made. A potential downside is that Agile requires careful communication management, especially in larger teams, to ensure consistent messaging and coordination.

Iterative model
The Iterative model divides the project into small, manageable parts (iterations), and each iteration produces a working version of the software. After each iteration, the software is tested and refined based on feedback until the final product meets all requirements. It follows a more rigid structure than Agile software development, with clearly defined steps focusing only on incremental improvements. 

This model enables better control of scope, time, and resources, facilitating the early detection of technical or architectural issues. However, there is limited scope for adapting to evolving requirements throughout the project. If an error goes undetected, all later iterations must be reworked—a problem known as ‘technical debt.’

V-Model
The V-Model focuses on testing at each stage of development. Every phase in the development process has a corresponding testing phase, ensuring that validation and verification are performed consistently. The V in the name does not reflect the words ‘validation’ and ‘verification’ but describes how the two processes are conducted in parallel yet take the project to a single completion point. That point corresponds to the Implementation phase, where coding begins.

This model ensures that issues are identified early, but it can be cumbersome if applied to complex projects that require frequent changes. 

DevOps model
The DevOps model emphasizes continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), bridging the gap between development and operations teams. It promotes collaboration and automation, ensuring code changes are quickly and safely deployed.

The other models often treat development and operations as separate phases or handoff points. The DevOps approach can be applied to any point of the process or even in combination with one of the traditional models. This is because, under DevOps, the components used in each phase are no longer considered to be living in separate silos or production environments.   

This results in faster delivery of features and updates but requires more upfront investment in specialized tools and qualified staff, making it difficult for small teams to implement.

Benefits of following an SDLC
There is an obvious benefit to eliminating chaos, but an SDLC framework builds on that idea in more ways than simply bringing order:

Improved project management: A structured process helps keep the project on a defined path and aligned with goals. When all team members follow the same process for every project, it’s easier for managers to maintain oversight and respond to milestones and deliverables, resulting in projects with a greater chance of conforming to schedules and budgets.

Consistent output quality: A consistent and systematic workflow results in consistency in the end product. Software engineers can produce high-quality solutions based on steps whose repeatability and reliability have been proven.

Risk mitigation: Each phase includes steps to identify and address risks, reducing the chances of costly errors. 

What are the risk factors?
Some software development models are better at managing risk than others. But what risks are we talking about?

Risk can be quite a broad area, encompassing factors that impact the timeline, budget, or product quality. There is technical risk relating to the reliability of the technology used or compatibility across different platforms/devices; financial risks such as cost overruns or insufficient funding; and scheduling risks such as delays due to bottlenecks or scope creep.

In recent years, however, governments have passed regulations calling for more attention to security risks such as software vulnerabilities, data breaches, and system weaknesses. As a result, developers have introduced the concept of DevSecOps into the software development process so that security testing occurs at every stage of development. In the past, it was often considered an afterthought, implemented only after perfecting the software's core functionality.

How to choose the right SDLC model
Every project and development team is different, so companies need to be aware of the different SDLC models and when to use each one. They will need to consider project size, complexity, budget, and team structure, among other variables. 

Here are some standard examples of pairing methodology with basic project characteristics :

Waterfall lends itself to small, time-limited projects with well-defined requirements and minimal client involvement.

Agile is ideal for large, complex projects that require frequent changes and close collaboration with multiple stakeholders.

A V-shaped model is best for time-limited projects with highly specific requirements prioritizing testing and quality assurance.

DevOps is perfect for teams seeking continuous integration and deployment in large projects, emphasizing long-term maintenance.

Within each model, there can be scope for using project management structures such as Scrum and Kanban, particularly when using complex, cyclical models like Agile. Let’s break each of those down further:
